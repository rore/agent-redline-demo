# AGENTS.md

This repo uses [agent-redline](https://github.com/rore/agent-redline). Before making changes:

1. Read `agent-policy.yaml`.
2. Classify your intended change as blue / red / gray (see `docs/agent/`).
3. Refuse to work around boundary rules. Fix the structure or escalate.

Per-checkpoint guidance lives in `docs/agent/`. Read the file matching the situation:

- `blue-zone-work.md` — autonomous work
- `red-zone-change.md` — architectural change
- `gray-zone-change.md` — unclassified path
- `boundary-violation.md` — the boundary backend reported a forbidden import
- `pr-discipline.md` — PR shape and description rules

Run the local check before pushing:

```bash
./scripts/agent-redline-check.sh
```
